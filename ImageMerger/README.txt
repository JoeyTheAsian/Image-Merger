This simple app will merge images vertically.
This is something I know comic artists sometimes struggle with when publishing online, including myself.
Which is why I made a really simple app to save some time.

HOW TO USE: 
1. PLACE YOUR FILES IN "OLD IMAGES"
2. NAME YOUR FILES ALPHABETICALLY. IMAGES ARE MERGED IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER OF THEIR FILE NAMES.
3. RUN "IMAGEMERGE.EXE"
4. VIOLA! RETREIVE YOUR MERGED IMAGE FROM "MERGED IMAGES"
